Fruits Test Task

Write a console script for getting all fruits from https://fruityvice.com/ and saving them into local DB (MySQL or PostgreSQL).

We will run this command from terminal, for example:

php bin/console fruits:fetch

When all fruits are saved into the DB send an email about it to a dummy admin email (e.g. test@gmail.com or your gmail address).

Create a page with all fruits (paginated). Add a form to filter fruits by name and family. Each fruit can be added to favorites (up to 10 fruits).

Create a page with favorite fruits. Display all nutrition facts for all fruits.

Add a README file with installation and startup instructions.

Treat the task as a full-fledged project. In php follow PSR-12, in JS follow JavaScript Standard Style. Unit tests are welcome. You should use the Symfony PHP framework for backend and VueJS (TypeScript optional) for frontend.

Once the project code is ready please upload it to a github repo and share with us the githup repo URL.z
